1.	Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:
Q= Square root of [(2*C*D)/H]
Following are the fixed values of C and H:
C is 50. H is 30.
D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.

#2.         Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The Square class has an init function which takes a length as argument. Both classes have an area function which can print the area of the shape where Shapeâ€™s area is 0 by default.

4.          What is the output of the following code? Explain your answer as well.

        self.y = 1
def main():
    b = Derived_Test()
    print(b.x,b.y)
main()
Output:
0 1
Reason: when main() function is called, object b of Derived_Test class is created which also inherits the properties of Test class.

Output:
(3, 1)
When the statement as "A.__init__(self, 3)" is executed, it passes value of x as 3 and obj.count() function is called, it increments the value of y by 1.
 
 
class A:

5.	Create a Time class and initialize it with hours and minutes.
Make a method addTime which should take two time object and add them. E.g.- (2 hour and 50 min)+(1 hr and 20 min) is (4 hr and 10 min)

Make a method DisplayMinute which should display the total minutes in the Time. E.g.- (1 hr 2 min) should display 62 minute.

6.           Write a Person class with an instance variable, , and a constructor that takes an integer, , as a parameter. The constructor must assign  to  after confirming the argument passed as  is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as , the constructor should set  to  and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. In addition, you must write the following instance methods:
yearPasses() should increase the  instance variable by .
amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
If , print You are young..
If  and , print You are a teenager..
Otherwise, print You are old..
